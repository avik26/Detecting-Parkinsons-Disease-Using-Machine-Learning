# Detecting-Parkinsons-Disease-Using-Machine-Learning
The project aimed to detect Parkinson's disease using machine learning algorithms by analyzing spiral drawings. Spiral drawings were collected from individuals, both with and without Parkinson's disease, and various features such as curvature, tremor, and speed were extracted from the drawings. These features were then used to train a machine learning model to differentiate between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's disease. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting the disease based on spiral drawings. This approach has the potential to provide a non-invasive and cost-effective method for early detection and monitoring of Parkinson's disease.
